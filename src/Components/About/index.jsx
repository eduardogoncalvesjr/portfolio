            <p>
              I began my career as a Translator
              and English Tutor. One day, driven
              by curiosity, I enrolled in an online
              front-end programming course, and it
              was a turning point in my life.
              I discovered a passion for programming
              and I am now dedicated to improving my skills every day. ‚ù§Ô∏è

              I have a great ability to communicate.
              I enjoy talking and I love teaching what
              I know. I can work in a team seamlessly
              guiding my team to success üöÄ
